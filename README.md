# OpenAPIClientWizard(beta)

Welcome to **OpenAPIClientWizard** â€“ the ultimate plugin for RAD Studio that revolutionizes the way Delphi developers implement REST API clients.

## Overview

As Delphi developers, we often face the challenge of implementing REST API clients. API documentation rarely includes Delphi code snippets, forcing us to read the documentation and implement each method - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE - manually. Even with Swagger or OpenAPI specifications, it's a time-consuming process. Without these specifications, we resort to tools like Delphi's REST Debugger or Postman, testing each method individually before coding them into our projects.

**OpenAPIClientWizard** changes all that. This powerful plugin reads Swagger, OpenAPI specifications, or Postman collection and generates a fully implemented client-side ample(VCL) project in Delphi, ready to compile, in just 2-3 seconds!

## IDE Version support
- **Supports from Delphi 10.1 Berlin to 12.x Athens**

## Features

- **Supports Swagger Specifications:** Handles JSON format effortlessly.
- **Supports OpenAPI Specifications:** Handles both JSON and YAML formats effortlessly.
- **Postman Collection Conversion:** Converts Postman collections into complete Delphi client projects.
- **Rapid Project Generation:** Generates fully implemented client-side projects in seconds, saving you a huge time(weeks of development).


## Benefits

- **Save Time:** Reduce weeks of work to mere seconds.
- **Increase Productivity:** Focus on building amazing applications instead of spending time on repetitive coding tasks.
- **Simplify Development:** Automate the creation of Delphi client-side projects from API specifications.
