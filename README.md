# OpenAPIClientWizard(beta)

Welcome to **OpenAPIClientWizard** â€“ the ultimate plugin for RAD Studio that revolutionizes the way Delphi developers implement REST API clients.

## Overview

As Delphi developers, we often face the challenge of implementing REST API clients. API documentation rarely includes Delphi code snippets, forcing us to read the documentation and implement each method - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE - manually. Even with Swagger or OpenAPI specifications, it's a time-consuming process. Without these specifications, we resort to tools like Delphi's REST Debugger or Postman, testing each method individually before coding them into our projects.

**OpenAPIClientWizard** changes all that. This powerful plugin reads Swagger, OpenAPI specifications, or Postman collection and generates a fully implemented client-side ample(VCL) project in Delphi, ready to compile, in just 2-3 seconds!

## Features

- **Supports Swagger Specifications:** Handles JSON format effortlessly.
- **Supports OpenAPI Specifications:** Handles both JSON and YAML formats effortlessly.
- **Postman Collection Conversion:** Converts Postman collections into complete Delphi client projects.
- **Rapid Project Generation:** Generates fully implemented client-side projects in seconds, saving you a huge time(weeks of development).

## Benefits

- **Save Time:** Reduce weeks of work to mere seconds.
- **Increase Productivity:** Focus on building amazing applications instead of spending time on repetitive coding tasks.
- **Simplify Development:** Automate the creation of Delphi client-side projects from API specifications.

## Getting Started

1. **Download and Install:** Follow the installation instructions in the repository.
2. **Run OpenAPIClientWizard:** Open your RAD Studio IDE and run the plugin.
3. **Generate Your Project:** Provide your Swagger or OpenAPI specification, or Postman collection, and let the plugin do the rest.
